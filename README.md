# Link Fixer Discord Bot

## The Why

- Dive into python and programming again to refresh and build on my college education.
- Get more experience with discord bots as I have a couple ideas regarding them.
- Have a fun project I can slowly expand on as I gain more knowledge of pytest, python structure, Linting...

## The What

This is a simple discord bot that fixes terrible ifunny.com mobile links that force a redirect to their website in order to view a video. So, in order to avoid this issue, I decided to automate the process.
